# Product Dropdown Fix for Admin Open Sale Page

## Problem
The `/admin/open-sale` page had a product dropdown that was not showing any products. This was caused by:
1. No products existing in the database
2. JavaScript logic not properly handling the product data from Thymeleaf

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Issue Fix
- **Root Cause**: No products existed in the database
- **Solution**: Created sample products through multiple methods:
  - SQL script: `insert_sample_products.sql`
  - Java endpoint: `/test/add-sample-products`

### 2. JavaScript Logic Fix
- **File**: `src/main/resources/templates/admin-open-sale.html`
- **Changes**:
  - Improved product array handling
  - Added better error checking
  - Enhanced dropdown population logic
  - Added proper option clearing

### 3. Repository Enhancement
- **File**: `src/main/java/com/brsons/repository/CategoryRepository.java`
- **Added**: `findByCategoryName()` method for category lookup

## Files Modified

1. `src/main/resources/templates/admin-open-sale.html` - Fixed JavaScript logic
2. `src/main/java/com/brsons/controller/TestDataController.java` - Added sample product creation
3. `src/main/java/com/brsons/repository/CategoryRepository.java` - Added missing method
4. `insert_sample_products.sql` - SQL script for manual product insertion

## Testing Instructions

### Method 1: Using Java Endpoint (Recommended)
1. Start the application
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:8085/test/add-sample-products`
3. This will create 8 sample products with proper categories
4. Navigate to: `http://localhost:8085/admin/open-sale`
5. The product dropdown should now show all available products

### Method 2: Using SQL Script
1. Connect to your PostgreSQL database
2. Run the `insert_sample_products.sql` script
3. Verify products were created
4. Test the admin open sale page

### Method 3: Manual Product Creation
1. Go to the admin panel
2. Use the "Add Product" functionality
3. Create products with status "Active"
4. Test the open sale page

## Verification
