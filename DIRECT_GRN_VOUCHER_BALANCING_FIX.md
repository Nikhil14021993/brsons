# Direct GRN Voucher Balancing Fix

## Problem Identified
The voucher creation was failing with a balancing error:
```
Total Debit: 222.00
Total Credit: 261.96
Error: Voucher is not balanced. Total Debit: 222.00, Total Credit: 261.96
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the voucher structure when we tried to make the tax amount a credit entry:

**Problematic Structure (Unbalanced):**
```
DEBIT ENTRIES:
- Purchase/Cost of Goods Sold (6001) ‚Üê 222.00 (Net Amount)

CREDIT ENTRIES:
- Duty and Taxes (7001) ‚Üê 39.96 (Tax Amount) 
- Accounts Payable (2001.01) ‚Üê 222.00 (Net Amount)

TOTAL DEBIT: 222.00
TOTAL CREDIT: 261.96 (39.96 + 222.00)
BALANCE: -39.96 (UNBALANCED!)
```

## Solution Implemented
Reverted the tax amount back to a **DEBIT entry** and fixed the voucher structure to ensure proper balancing.

### **Corrected Voucher Structure (Balanced):**
```
DEBIT ENTRIES:
- Purchase/Cost of Goods Sold (6001) ‚Üê 222.00 (Net Amount)
- Duty and Taxes (7001) ‚Üê 39.96 (Tax Amount)

CREDIT ENTRY:
- Accounts Payable (2001.01) ‚Üê 261.96 (Grand Total)

TOTAL DEBIT: 261.96 (222.00 + 39.96)
TOTAL CREDIT: 261.96 (Grand Total)
BALANCE: 0.00 (BALANCED!)
```

## Changes Made

### 1. GRNService.java
**Reverted Changes:**
- Changed tax amount from credit back to debit entry
- Updated Accounts Payable to credit Grand Total (not just Net Amount)
- Updated logging messages to reflect correct structure

**Code Changes:**
```java
// Debit Entry 1: Net Amount to Purchase/Cost of Goods Sold
entries.add(new VoucherEntryDto(purchaseAccountId, netAmount, null, "Purchase/Cost of Goods Sold - " + grn.getGrnNumber()));

// Debit Entry 2: Tax Amount to Duty and Taxes (REVERTED TO DEBIT)
entries.add(new VoucherEntryDto(taxAccountId, taxAmount, null, "Duty and Taxes - " + grn.getGrnNumber()));

// Credit Entry: Grand Total to Accounts Payable (FIXED TO GRAND TOTAL)
entries.add(new VoucherEntryDto(payableAccountId, null, grandTotal, "Accounts Payable - " + grn.getGrnNumber()));
```

### 2. create_grn_split_accounts.sql
**Reverted Changes:**
- Changed Duty and Taxes account type back to LIABILITY
- Updated account descriptions to reflect debit nature

**SQL Changes:**
```sql
-- Create Duty and Taxes account (Code: 7001) - DEBIT ACCOUNT FOR TAX
INSERT INTO account (code, name, type, description, is_active) 
SELECT '7001', 'Duty and Taxes', 'LIABILITY', 'Duty and Taxes', TRUE
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM account WHERE code = '7001');
```

## Expected Results

```

### Database Entries:
| Account | Code  | Debit  | Credit | Description |
|---------|-------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Purchase/Cost of Goods Sold | 6001 | 222.00 | 0.00 | Purchase/Cost of Goods Sold - GRN4098984D9 |
| Duty and Taxes | 7001 | 39.96 | 0.00 | Duty and Taxes - GRN4098984D9 |
| Accounts Payable | 2001.01 | 0.00 | 261.96 | Accounts Payable - GRN4098984D9 |

## Accounting Logic

The corrected voucher structure follows proper double-entry bookkeeping:

1. **Net Amount (222.00)** ‚Üí Debit Purchase/Cost of Goods Sold (6001)
   - Records the cost of goods purchased (after discount)

2. **Tax Amount (39.96)** ‚Üí Debit Duty and Taxes (7001)
   - Records tax expense as a debit

3. **Grand Total (261.96)** ‚Üí Credit Accounts Payable (2001.01)
   - Records the total amount owed to supplier

**Balancing:**
- Total Debits: 222.00 + 39.96 = 261.96
- Total Credits: 261.96
- Balance: 0.00 ‚úÖ

## Key Benefits

1. **Proper Balancing**: Total debits = Total credits
2. **Correct Accounting**: Tax is treated as an expense (debit)
3. **Accurate Reporting**: Clear separation of goods cost and tax expense
4. **No Errors**: Voucher creation will succeed without balancing errors

## Testing Instructions

1. **Run the updated SQL script** to ensure account 7001 exists
2. **Create a Direct GRN** with items, discounts, and taxes
3. **Approve the GRN** and verify:
   - No balancing errors in console
   - Voucher entries created successfully
   - Amounts split correctly between accounts
